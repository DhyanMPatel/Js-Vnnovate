# Python Mastery Hub

## Trending Learning Requirements (Start Here)

1. **Strong Core Syntax & Typing Discipline** – Write clean, idiomatic Python 3.12+ code, leverage typing hints, and understand the interpreter lifecycle.
2. **Problem-Solving with Data Structures & Algorithms** – Master built-in collections, `heapq`, `bisect`, graph/search techniques, and complexity-driven design.
3. **Robust Architecture & OOP Patterns** – Design modular packages, apply SOLID principles, master dataclasses, descriptors, and dependency injection approaches used in large systems.
4. **Performance & Concurrency Awareness** – Optimize with vectorization, profiling, asyncio, multiprocessing, and C extensions (Cython/Numba) when necessary.
5. **Production-Ready Tooling** – Use virtual environments, packaging, logging, testing (pytest), linting, formatting, CI/CD basics, and observability hooks.
6. **AI/ML Ecosystem Fluency** – Be comfortable with NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow/JAX, Hugging Face, MLflow, and deployment stacks (FastAPI, Ray, Triton).
7. **Data Engineering & MLOps Touchpoints** – Understand SQL/NoSQL connectors, messaging queues, feature stores, orchestration (Airflow, Prefect), and experiment tracking.
8. **Security & Reliability Mindset** – Handle secrets, validate data, sandbox code, and design safe APIs needed for FAANG-grade systems.

## Concepts Covered in This Folder

- **01_Foundations.md** – Syntax, execution model, primitive & composite data types, operators, I/O.
- **02_Control_and_Modularity.md** – Control flow, functions, higher-order patterns, modules, packaging basics.
- **03_OOP_and_Design.md** – Classes, inheritance, dataclasses, descriptors, SOLID patterns, dependency management.
- **04_Advanced_Python.md** – Iterators, generators, decorators, context managers, concurrency (threads, asyncio, multiprocessing).
- **05_Data_IO_Testing.md** – File handling, serialization, error handling, logging, testing strategies, packaging & tooling.
- **06_Algorithms_and_Performance.md** – Core data structures, algorithm templates, complexity analysis, profiling & optimization tactics.
- **07_AI_ML_Ecosystem.md** – Scientific computing stack, ML/DL frameworks, data pipelines, deployment considerations, recommended libraries.

Each file mixes theory, annotated code examples, and “Further Research” sections so you know what to collect from other sources.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Read sequentially** from `01_Foundations.md` to `07_AI_ML_Ecosystem.md` to build layered understanding.
2. **Practice actively** – retype code blocks, tweak inputs, and run in a REPL or notebook.
3. **Create flashcards/notes** for definitions, gotchas, and syntax patterns while reading.
4. **Pair topics with LeetCode/FAANG-style problems** to cement problem solving.
5. **Iterate** – revisit chapters with real project context (APIs, scripts, ML experiments).

## Study Strategy Toward FAANG-Level Interviews

1. **Month 1: Core Python & Control Structures** – Finish files 01 & 02, implement 30+ mini scripts.
2. **Month 2: OOP + Advanced Features** – Deep dive files 03 & 04, refactor personal project using patterns described.
3. **Month 3: Systems Thinking & Tooling** – Apply lessons from file 05 to build a CLI, ship it with packaging/testing.
4. **Month 4: Algorithms Focus** – Use file 06 as daily reference; solve DS&A problems in Python, profile solutions.
5. **Month 5+: AI/ML Specialization** – Follow file 07 to assemble ML portfolio projects, integrate with MLOps stack.

## Key Outcomes After Completing All Files

- Ability to read and write production-grade Python codebases quickly.
- Confidence using the standard library and third-party ecosystems for backend + ML work.
- Interview-ready knowledge for FAANG problem-solving, system design, and ML discussions.
- Clear list of advanced areas to research further (see final section in each file).

### Repository-Wide: Additional Topics to Research Externally

- Latest Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) in flight and their adoption timelines.
- Company-specific frameworks (e.g., Meta’s internal PyTorch forks, Google’s internal RPC frameworks).
- Proprietary data infrastructure (feature stores, label management tools) used inside FAANG companies.
- Compliance requirements (PII handling, federated learning governance) unique to your target teams.
