# Assignement 2

- Create a npm project and install Express.js (Nodemon as dev dependency)
- Create on Express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware functions that log something to the console and return one response.
- Handle request to "/" and "/users" such that each request only has one handler/middleware that does something with it (e.g. send dummy response).
