## Semantic Versioning

- Semantic Versioning is a `standard for versioning software` that's widely adopted in the npm ecosystem. It provides a clear and consistent way to communicate changes in a software package to users.

### Version Format
- A semantic version number consists of three parts separated by dots:

    - MAJOR: Incremented when there are incompatible API changes.
    - MINOR: Incremented when new functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner.
    - PATCH: Incremented when bug fixes are made without affecting the API.
