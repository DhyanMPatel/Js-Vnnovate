# Third Party Packages

- There are several Third Party Packages which are used to make our work easy.
- There packages will be devDependencies and dependencies.

- `dependencies` : These are the packages which are `required to run` our application.

    ```js
    npm install express
    ```

- `devDependencies` : These are the packages which are `required to develop` our application.

    ```js
    npm install nodemon --save-dev
    ```

- `npm install <package-name>` : This will install the package in dependencies.
- `npm install <package-name> --save-dev` : This will install the package in devDependencies.
