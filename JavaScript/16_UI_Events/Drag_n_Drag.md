# Drag’n’Drop algorithm

- The basic Drag’n’Drop algorithm looks like this:

  - On `mousedown` – prepare the element for moving, if needed (maybe create a clone of it, add a class to it or whatever).
  - Then on `mousemove` move it by changing left/top with position:absolute.
  - On `mouseup` – perform all actions related to finishing the drag’n’drop.

- There is good Functionality which should i watch in future.
