# Scrolling

- The scroll event allows reacting to a page or element scrolling
- few good thing we can do here:
  - Show/hide additional controls or information depending on where in the document the user is.
  - Load more data when the user scrolls down till the end of the page.
- there are multiple properties like `scrollTo`, `scrollBy`, etc.
