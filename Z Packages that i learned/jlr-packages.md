# Parts of Package.json

## dependencies

- These are packages your app **needs to run in production**.

- Installed when someone runs `npm install --production` (or just `npm install`).

## devDependencies

- These are tools used **only during development** and not needed in production.
- They include:
  - Linters (ESLint)
  - Formatters (Prettier)
  - Testing libraries (Jest, Cypress)
  - Build tools (Webpack, Vite, Babel)
  - TypeScript
  - Sass compilers, etc.

## Scripts

- The "scripts" section defines custom command-line shortcuts to automate tasks like building, testing, starting, or deploying your app.

You run these with **`npm run <script-name>`** (or `yarn <script-name>` in Yarn projects).

## browserList

- The `"browserslist"` field tells tools like Babel, Autoprefixer, and build tools which browsers you want to support.

## Resolution

- The "resolutions" field in package.json is used to force a specific version of a dependency (or sub-dependency) across your project ‚Äî especially in projects using Yarn (though npm now supports similar features via overrides).

- Let's say your project depends on a library A, which uses lodash@4.17.15, but there's a known bug in that version and you want to use lodash@4.17.21 instead.

- You can‚Äôt directly change A‚Äôs package, but you can override it globally using resolutions.

## overrides

- overrides is a field in package.json that lets you override specific dependency versions, including transitive (nested) dependencies ‚Äî similar to **resolutions** in Yarn.

- Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre using a package (package-a) that depends on an outdated or vulnerable version of lodash, and you want to force all packages to use a newer version.
