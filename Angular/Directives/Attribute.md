# Attribute Directives

- Directives are the fundamental concepts in angular that help us to `add` or `modify` the **behavior or appearance of HTML elements**.

### Benefits of Attribute Directive:

1. **Dynamic Styling** : Used to `dynamically apply styles` to HTML elements based on certain conditions.

2. **DOM Manipulation** : Enable you to `interact with` and `manipulate` **the DOM** based on user actions or application state changes.

3. **Reusability** : Promote code reuse by `encapsulating behavior` that can be applied to multiple elements across the application.

4. **Enhanced Functionality** : Extend HTML with custom functionality, improving the overall user experience.

## Types of Attribute Directives

### 1. Built-in Attribute Directive:
