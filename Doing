Today, I am working on below list of task:

1. Window Size & Scrolling
   - Understand clientWidth/clientHeight for window, scrollWidth/scrollHeight for document width/height.
   - Window.pageYOffset/pageXOffset to get current scroll same as window.scrollX/scrollY.
   - Understand scrolling like scrollTo, scrollBy, scrollIntoView.
2. Coordinates

   - Understand about getBoundingClientRect() for perticular Area.
   - Understand elementFromPoint(x,y) to get elem at that coordinate.

3. Intro of Browser events

   - Know about different types of Browser Event like Mouse events, Keyboard events, form element events, Document events, css events.
   - Know about addEventListener() and their arguments
   - Know about Event Object that occurs in each event.
   - Also we can take handler as an Object and use handleEvent() method.

4. Bubbling & Capturing

   - Understood the difference between Bubbling and Capturing
   - Know about event.target Property.
   - using event.stopPropagation() we can stop Bubbling.

5. Event Delegation

   - through Bubbling and Capturing we can impliment Event Delegation
   - Delegation is a process where we add event at parent element to minimize the event handler.

6. Browser Default Actions

   - There are many events automatically lead like, `touchstart`, `touchmove` in Mobile, `click on submit button`, etc.
   - There are 2 method to handle that `event.preventDefault()` and `event.defaultPrevented`.
