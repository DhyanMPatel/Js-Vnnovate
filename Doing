## Apology letter

to: Rahul
Cc: 

Subject: Apology for the Coding Error on 12th September

Dear Rahul sir,

I would like to apologize for the mistake I made in the code on 12th September 2025. The issue occurred in the condition where the error-handling logic was implemented incorrectly.

Also, there was limited time and several ongoing changes, which might have led to this issue. I’ve reviewed the code and will ensure to check similar conditions carefully in future implementations.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Dhyan
