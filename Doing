Today, I am working on below list of task:

   - Make some change to pass selected rows per page value. - Done

6. There is problem in API response when search feature use in Vehicle Report, Vehicle Ownership and Accessories module. needs to changes from backend side. - Done

## For me to understand,

Project: Dealer Data,

1. User List Module,

- Problem: Search with filter not work.
- Suggestion: Remove Search functionality from Role. (Backend side)

2. Customer Data

- Problem: per page pass platform(profile_type) filter only for 1st time. - Done
- Suggestion: check what thing pass while changing per page value. (Frontend side)

- Problem: Not work properly "show error records". - Done
- Suggestion: When disable "show error records" pass value "".

3. Exception Email

- Display total of Exception email. - Done

4. Vehicle Report

- Problem: Per page not work properly. - Done
- Suggestion: check when change value of perpage then which value is passed in API. because when i select 100 it pass 25(previous).

- Problem: Search functionality not work.
- Suggestion: check what happened when called. (Ex- there "SALEA7AWXP2147514" should be only single row. but count property value is wrong in API response.)

5. Vehicle Ownership

- Suggestion:

6. Accessories

- Suggestion:

7. Report

- Suggestion:
