Today, I am working on below list of task:

Project - KMZ,

1. Display Images in Report Table - Done
2. Add new Report with Images - Done
3. Download Report list in CSV format with API - Done
4. edit Report with Images - In Progress

What i do - kal images Report Table me display karvai thi. Add report wale section bhi khatam ho gaya. At last CSV Download me temporary link generate karke csv file download karke dekh liya tha.


## issue faced

1: Formating createAt and updatedAt
Problem: Difficult to format date in required type in less code
solution: Using dayjs package it become quite simple

2: Grid set Dynamically
Problem: display fixed rows and collumns in grid is quit difficult to solve
Solution: solved using another state (rowsPerPage, colsPerPage).

3. change data of perticular row in Grid task
   Problem: when click on right button in any row it change all rows data not only perticular row
   Solution: not solved

4. Images get in report
   problem: Images come from different id and other data come from different id
   Solution: need to merge data come from report api and images api and set based on reports with their order

5. get CSV data from backend
   Problem: first time handle csv data in life
   solution: getting `response.data` which is blob data. then needs to creat object URL of **blob data**. At last create link that has attribute `download` that is use to download any file in `href` attribute.

   ```js
   // Convert response to Blob (Binary Large Object)
   const blob = await response.data;
   const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);

   console.log(`url: `, url); // output look like:  blob:http://localhost:5173/1543a798-8b0e-4b4a-87bd-d027b33348a5

   // // Create a temporary download link
   const link = document.createElement("a"); // create a tag.
   link.href = url;
   link.setAttribute("download", "report_data.csv"); // Filename from API
   document.body.appendChild(link);
   link.click();
   document.body.removeChild(link);
   ```
