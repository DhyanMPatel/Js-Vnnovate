Subject: Apology for the Coding Error on 12th September

Dear Rahul sir,

I would like to apologize for the mistake I made in the code on 12th September 2025. The issue occurred in the condition where the error-handling logic was implemented incorrectly.

Also, there was limited time and several ongoing changes, which might have led to this issue. I’ve reviewed the code and will ensure to check similar conditions carefully in future implementations.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

1. New Feature Requirement – Lead Creation Enhancement

- Please implement the following feature based on the points below.
- Initial Instructions
  - First, review all relevant existing files to clearly understand exactly what needs to be done.
  - The flow described below is based on my understanding. If you find a simpler or more user-friendly solution, you may propose and implement it.
    - You are encouraged to explore existing solutions, documentation, or references (e.g., online resources, tutorials, etc.) if needed.

- Feature Flow
  - When a user clicks Create Lead, the system should prompt the user to select one of the following options:
    - New Lead
    - Existing Lead
  - If the user selects “New Lead”
    - The current lead creation flow should remain unchanged.
  - If the user selects “Existing Lead”
    - Display an additional search input field.
    - Allow the user to search leads using First Name and Last Name.
    - Show a dropdown list of matching leads, displaying:
      - Full Name
      - Country
      - City
  - When a lead is selected from the dropdown:
    - Open the Create Lead form.
    - Pre-fill the form with all existing lead details.
    - Do not auto-fill the following fields:
      - Upload Documents
      - Requirement fields

1. Dialog Modal as Stepper
  - Please handle the dialog modal as a stepper-based flow.
  - If the user closes the modal at any step, it should always reopen from the first step, which is the option selection modal:
    - New Lead
    - Existing Lead

2. Console Log on Create Lead (Existing Lead Flow)
  - When the user clicks the Create Lead button after selecting the Existing Lead option, please log the action in the console.

3. Console Log Lead Details
  - After the user clicks the Create Lead button, log the following in the console:
    - The existing lead details
    - The newly created/current lead details
  - Both logs should include the full details of each lead.

Backend changes

1. API & Database Changes
  - Pass a new field isExistLead (boolean) from the frontend to the backend through the API.
  - Add a corresponding is_exist_lead column in the database to store this value.

2. Validation Rules (When isExistLead = true)
  - Apply only basic validations, such as:
    - Required fields must not be empty.
    - Basic data type checks (if applicable).
  - Skip all other advanced validations.

3. Duplicate Checks
  - When isExistLead = true, do not perform uniqueness/duplicate checks for:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Email
    - Phone Number
  - These values may already exist for other leads and should be allowed.
