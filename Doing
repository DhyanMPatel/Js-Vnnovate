Today, I am working on below list of task:

1. Start learning React with questions

   - What is React?, How it works?, Why React?, Features of React, Advantages and Disadvantages of React.

2. Learn LifeCycle of Class Component

   - There are total 4 phases. `Initialization`, `Mounting`, `Updating`, `Unmounting` phases and their Methods like
     - `Initialization` - getInitialState(), getDefaultProps()
     - `Mounting` - constructor(), static getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), componentDidMount()
     - `Updating` - static getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getsnapshotBeforeUpdate(), componentDidUpdate()
     - `Unmounting` - componentWillUnmount()

3. Learn about Components and types of components

4. Know Events in React and event handling.
   - React events handling are just like HTML-like handling with JSX Syntax.
