Today, I am working on below list of task:

1. TextDecoder & TextEncoder

   - From this Topic i learn about encoding and decoding using `decoder.decode()`, `encoder.encode()`.

2. Blob

   - From this topic i learn about blob(binary large Object) use to store large binary data like image,text,video, etc.
   - also we can use blob as URL using `URL.createObjectURL()`. And using `fileReader` Object we can conver Blob to Base64.
   - also i know about `Blob to ArrayBuffer` and `Blog to Stream`.

3. File and FileReader

   - `file` Obj inherits from `blob`, so same as blob Object we can create file.
   - `fileReader` main purpose is reading data from `blob` using Methods like `readArrayBuffer(blob)`, `readAsText(blob)`, `abort()`.
   - for Reading process there are events like: `loadstart`, `progress`, `load`, `aboat`, `error`, `loadend`.

4. Cookie

   - using `document.cookie` can create Cookie. this is `name=value` pair.
   - Also learn about attributes like `domain`, `path`, `expire & max-age`, `secure`, `samesite`, `httpOnly`.

5. LocalStorage & SessionStorage

   - From this topic i learn about LocalStorage and SessionStorage also learn about their methods like `setItem()`, `getItem()`, `removeItem()`, `clear()`, `key(index)`, `length`.

6. Regular Expression
   - I learn about Anchors like `^`, `$`.
   - char classes like `\d`,`\D`,`\s`, `\S`, `\w`, `\W`. `.`
   - pattern and flag like `i,g,m,s,u,y`
   - Quentifiers like {n}
   - set and Range fot multi options
   - Word Boundary `\b`, to check boundary of word.
