    - `dynamically importing` the Login component using **React Lazy Loading**.
    - use for low initial Bundle size (Faster page load)
  - Ex.

    ```js
    const Login = lazy(() => import("./pages/auth/login"));
    ```

    ```html
    <Suspense fallback={ <Loading isLoading={isLoading}/> }>
        <Login />
    </Suspense>
    ```
