## 🎯 Why DSA Matters

### For FAANG Interviews

- **Technical Interviews**: 90% focus on DSA problem-solving
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Demonstrates analytical thinking
- **Code Quality**: Shows you can write efficient, clean code
- **Communication**: Explaining your approach is crucial

### Real-World Applications

- **Performance Optimization**: Better algorithms = faster applications
- **Scalability**: Handling millions of users efficiently
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable parts
- **System Design**: Choosing the right data structures for the job

## 📚 Prerequisites

### Must-Have Skills

```javascript
// 1. JavaScript Fundamentals
const arrays = [1, 2, 3];
const objects = { name: "John", age: 25 };
const functions = () => console.log("Hello World");

// 2. ES6+ Features
const arrowFunctions = (x) => x * 2;
const destructuring = ({ name, age } = user);
const spread = [...array1, ...array2];

// 3. Basic Programming Concepts
// - Variables, data types, operators
// - Control flow (if/else, loops)
// - Functions and scope
// - Basic error handling
```

### Recommended Knowledge

- **Math**: Basic algebra, logarithms, probability
- **Logic**: Problem-solving mindset
- **Persistence**: DSA requires consistent practice

## 💡 Study Strategy

### The 3-Step Learning Approach

#### 1. **Theory First** (30%)

- Understand the concept
- Learn the properties and trade-offs
- Know when to use it

#### 2. **Implementation** (40%)

- Code it yourself from scratch
- Understand every line
- Test with different inputs

#### 3. **Practice Problems** (30%)

- Solve 3-5 problems per concept
- Start easy, gradually increase difficulty
- Focus on problem recognition

### Daily Study Schedule

```
🌅 Morning (30 min): Review previous concepts
🌞 Afternoon (1 hour): Learn new concept + implement
🌆 Evening (30 min): Solve practice problems
🌙 Night (15 min): Quick review + plan tomorrow
```

### Weekly Schedule

```
Monday-Wednesday: Learn new concepts
Thursday-Friday: Practice problems
Saturday: Review week + mock interviews
Sunday: Rest + light review
```

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup

### Required Tools

```bash
# 1. Node.js (Latest LTS)
node --version

# 2. Code Editor (VS Code recommended)
# Install these extensions:
# - JavaScript Booster
# - Code Runner
# - GitLens
# - Prettier
```

### Development Environment

```javascript
// Create a DSA project structure
const dsaProject = {
  folder: "DSA-Practice",
  structure: {
    "solutions/": "Your implementations",
    "tests/": "Test cases",
    "notes/": "Learning notes",
    "resources/": "Reference materials",
  },
};
```

### Online Platforms for Practice
